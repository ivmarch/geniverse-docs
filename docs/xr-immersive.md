# XR and Immersiveness

GeniVerse can use extended reality (XR) technologies — virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) — as an additional tool for visualizing complex topics, practical simulations, and learning through interaction.

*XR is not a mandatory component of the learning process. The platform is designed to fully function without XR, and immersive scenarios are applied where they provide measurable pedagogical benefit.*
