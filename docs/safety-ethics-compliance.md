# Safety, Ethics, and Compliance

GeniVerse adheres to high standards of security, ethical AI use, and regulatory compliance. This section describes the platform's approach to protecting students, maintaining privacy, transparent AI application, and meeting legal and industry standard requirements.

Key principle: Each institution's data is isolated. Only authorized administration and users of a specific institution have access to data within their roles. The platform does not use one institution's data for other institutions without explicit consent and agreed procedures.
